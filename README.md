- Sad songs have low dancebility, low energy, moderate tempo and low duration
- Happy songs have high energy, high dancebility, low duration and moderate tempo
- Most of the Calm songs have high energy, high danceability, high duration and moderate tempo
- There is a high correlation between loudness and energy
